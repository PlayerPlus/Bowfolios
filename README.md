# Bowfolio App 

## Project Progress

### Week1: Self-learning

Week 1 is for the very fundamental iOS development tech stack.


### Week2: Self-development

In week 2, I was starting to learn react the library and also refreshed on Java. I have no experience so far with app developent and react.

### Week3: Self-development

In week 3, I was setting up all my required programs and libraries I will need. I started to look into app development in react native more thoroughly, specifically on examples like Bowfolio and went line by line and looked over the code.

## Developer Guide

1. There are two options to try out the app. You can retrieve the Bowfolios source code from our GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/PlayerPlus/Bowfolios">here</a>.

2. You can try out the app on an IOS simulator.

1.1 Clone the repository to GitHub Desktop.

1.3 Open it with Command Prompt and type cd bowfolios to change to the app folder

1.4 Type 'npm install' and after it is done, type 'npm run ios'  to run the program.

2.1 Download code from github and run ot on an IOS Emulator, like [this](https://appetize.io/)
